Finished the first iteration of [lwnws](https://github.com/dfyockey/lwnws), a utility to provide current local weather information for a given latitude and longitude based on U.S. National Weather Service data. The motivation for the project was to provide weather info for use with [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky). It has a number of enhancement issues that I aim to work on but, at the moment, no known bugs. Contributions to resolving issues and/or submission of new issues suggesting enhancements, pointing out bugs, etc are welcome.

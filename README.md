5 Aug 2021 - Finally finished putting together a bit of documentation on setting up a LibreOffice extension project in Eclipse where the [LOEclipse](https://github.com/LibreOffice/loeclipse) plugin fails to generate skeleton code, as is the case on my system running Fedora Linux. I created the documentation for myself to have the steps available in case I needed to repeat the process in case I need them again in the future. But I figured that someone else might find the information useful, so I've made it available at https://dfyockey.github.io/documentation/New_Extension_Project_Instructions_-_LOEclipse_Framework_Base.odt.

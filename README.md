![Hello, World](Screenshot_2021-07-08_12-02-36.png)

I'm currently documenting how to set up a LibreOffice extension project in Eclipse where the [LOEclipse](https://github.com/LibreOffice/loeclipse) plugin fails to generate skeleton code such a project as it's supposed to (e.g. when used in Fedora Linux). I already managed to make a working extension by combining code copied from the [libreoffice-starter-extension](https://github.com/smehrbrodt/libreoffice-starter-extension) project with the framework generated by LOEclipse, so I know it can be done; just hadn't thoughly documented the steps.

Of course it's possible to just import the libreoffice-starter-extension project and build straight off of that. But that project is entwined with a generic name, root package, and etc, so it's not really workable as the foundation for a real extension project.

It'd be great to just fix the LOEclipse plugin, but who knows how long that would take to work out. I might take a stab at fixing it when I'm in the mood to dive into a potential rabbit hole.
